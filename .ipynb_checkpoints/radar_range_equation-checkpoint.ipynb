    "### Receiver Thermal Noise\n",
    "\n",
    "Thermal noise, often referred to as \"white\" noise due to its uniform power spectral density, is a significant factor in radar systems, impacting the ability to detect target signals. This noise, generated by various environmental sources and internal receiver components, is proportional to the receiver bandwidth and system temperature. The noise power can be quantified using the equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ P_n = k T_S B = k T_0 F B$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where\n",
    "- $k$ is Boltzmann constant ($1.38 × 10−23 \\frac{Watt\\cdot sec}{K}$ or $1.38 × 10−23 \\frac{Joule}{K}$) \n",
    "     - **Note to units**: 1 Watt = 1 Joule per second ($1W = 1 J/s$) \n",
    "- $T_0$ is the standard temperature ($290 K$).\n",
    "- $T_s$ is the system noise temperature ($T_s = T_0 F$).\n",
    "- $B$ is the instantaneous receiver bandwidth in $Hz$.\n",
    "- $F$ is the noise figure of the receiver subsystem (unitless).\n",
    "\n",
    "As can be seen from the equation, the noise power is linearly proportional to the receiver bandwidth. However, reducing the receiver bandwidth to decrease noise power can adversely affect the target signal, as the bandwidth of the target’s signal in one received pulse is approximately the reciprocal of the pulse width ($B \\approx 1/\\tau$). If the receiver bandwidth is smaller than the target signal bandwidth, target power is reduced and range resolution suffers. Conversely, if the receiver bandwidth is larger, the signal-to-noise ratio will decrease. The optimal bandwidth is typically around $1.2/\\tau$, but $1/\\tau$ is often used as an approximation [1]."
